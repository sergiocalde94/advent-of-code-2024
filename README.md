# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to the Advent of Code 2024! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

## What is this?

Advent of Code is an annual event where programmers from around the world come together to solve a series of daily coding challenges. Think of it as a digital advent calendar, but instead of chocolates, you get brain-bending puzzles. And let's be honest, who needs chocolates when you have code?

## How it works

1. **Daily Challenges**: Every day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is released at midnight EST. 
2. **Solve the Puzzles**: Use your favorite programming language to solve the puzzles. Python, JavaScript, Brainf**k, you name it!
3. **Earn Stars**: Each puzzle has two parts. Solve both parts to earn two shiny stars. Collect all 50 stars to become the ultimate code ninja.
4. **Bragging Rights**: Show off your stars and solutions to your friends, family, and that one colleague who thinks they're better than you.

## Why participate?

- **Sharpen Your Skills**: Improve your problem-solving and coding skills.
- **Join the Community**: Be part of a global community of coders.
- **Have Fun**: Because who doesn't love a good challenge?

## Tips for Success

- **Stay Calm**: Some puzzles might make you question your life choices. Breathe in, breathe out, and keep coding.
- **Ask for Help**: If you're stuck, the community is here to help. Just don't expect them to do your homework.
- **Enjoy the Ride**: Remember, it's all about having fun and learning something new.

## Disclaimer

No programmers were harmed in the making of these puzzles. Any resemblance to real-life coding challenges is purely coincidental. Side effects may include sleepless nights, excessive coffee consumption, and an uncontrollable urge to refactor code.

Happy coding and may the stars be with you! ðŸŒŸ
